# HTML Basics Internship Project

# About the Project
This project was created as part of my internship learning to strengthen my **HTML and CSS fundamentals**.  
The main goal was to understand how a basic website is structured and styled using core web technologies.

It helped me practice writing clean HTML, applying external CSS, and making the webpage responsive.
